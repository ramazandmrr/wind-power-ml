## 3rd Wind Power Project

- **Description**: I developed a project that evaluates the potential of wind energy and produces electricity using this opportunity. The project determines the most efficient energy production points by making temperature predictions based on wind speed, perspective and other effects received from the user.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Tkinter, CatBoost, XGBoost, HTTP API
- **Features**:
  - Temperature prediction from the user using city, wind speed, wind angle and curtain angle.
  - Predictions with different machine builder models (LSTM, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, XGBoost).
  - Display of results with a user-friendly program.
